A To Do application 
---------------------------------

This is just a template application for me to clone when starting projects.  This one 
uses Jersey (JAX-RS) and JPA for the backend.  Angular and Bootstrap are the big pieces 
on the front end.

To build and start the application using Tomcat:

	mvn clean install tomcat7:run
Then point your browser at:

	http://localhost:8080/
